**Projects**

1.  **Crime Data Analysis Project (2022-2024)**
    * **Goal:** To understand crime trends across the UK by analyzing crime type, geographical location (LSOAs), and reporting police agency.
    * **Data Processing:** Developed an **ETL pipeline** using AWS services. Raw crime data, stored in Amazon S3, was cataloged and made queryable using **Glue Crawler**. Amazon Athena was used to query and aggregate this data. Amazon QuickSight was used for creating visualizations such as bar charts (for crime types and police force reporting trends) and stacked bar charts (for crime distribution across LSOAs).
    * **Key Findings:** Identified **violence and sexual offences** as the most frequent crime type with **5,937,043** incidents. **Anti-social behaviour** was the second most common with **2,741,817** incidents. Other high-frequency crimes included **public order (1,348,841)**, **criminal damage and arson (1,344,782)**, **other theft (1,298,173)**, and **shoplifting (1,111,324)**. The **Metropolitan Police Service** reported the highest number of total crimes: approximately **1.1 million in 2022**, **1.13 million in 2023**, and **0.95 million in 2024**. Crime type distribution varied across different Local Super Output Areas (LSOAs). Note: Data quality issues were identified with some LSOA names appearing as crime types.
2.  Data Analysis Project: The Effects of Ethnicity on Students' Behaviour and Outcomes | Aston University
    * Data Extraction and Manipulation: Utilized Python and SQL to extract and manipulate a large dataset of student information, including demographics, socioeconomic factors, and academic performance metrics. Data sources: Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), National Pupil Database (NPD) (with necessary approvals).
    * Data Analysis and Visualization: Employed statistical techniques (Normality Testing, Variance Analysis, Non-parametric Tests, Post-Hoc Analysis, Predictive Modeling, Correlation Analysis) to analyze data and identify trends. Visualizations created to communicate findings.
    * Outcomes: Identified a 15% performance gap between certain ethnic groups, highlighting the impact of socioeconomic factors. Developed a predictive model with 80% accuracy for identifying at-risk students.
3.  Electoral Bond Data Analysis
    * Data Extraction and Manipulation: Extracted and cleaned electoral bond data from the Election Commission of India's website.
    * Data Analysis and Visualization: Analyzed data using Power BI. Visualized transaction trends, donor information, key insights.
    * Outcomes: Showcased a 300% increase in electoral bond transactions between 2019 and 2023. Identified the top 3 purchasers, responsible for 40% of total transactions. Highlighted seasonal trends, with 60% of transactions occurring in the first quarter.
4.  Global University Performance Analysis
    * Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL): ETL workflow used to extract data from Times Higher Education, QS World University Rankings, and ARWU. Transformed using Azure Databricks, loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics.
    * Data Analysis and Visualization: Analyzed global university rankings, funding impacts, and attainment levels. Visualizations created using Power BI.
    * Outcomes: Found a 0.8 correlation between research funding and university ranking. Identified key performance indicators with 95% confidence intervals.
